This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript. The `add` function is defined to accept two number parameters but is called with a string.  This results in a type error because TypeScript's type system catches the mismatch at compile time. The solution shows how to fix the type error by explicitly converting the string to a number before passing it to the function.
